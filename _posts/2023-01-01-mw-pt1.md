TL;DR: How to enable reconciliation windows for a GitOps Setup using the suspension feature of the flux `Kustomize` controller and K8s CronJobs to schedule the windows.

When using [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/) to manage a K8s cluster every new change in your repository will be immediately applied to the cluster's state. Now, this behavior is useful for many scenarios, but unfortunately not for all.
In some use cases, the newest changes to a GitOps repository should only apply to the cluster within a designated time window.
As an example the cluster should reconcile to the newest changes of the GitOps respoitory between Monday 8am to Thursday 5pm. Any change comming in to the GitOps repository on Friday or the weekend will have to wait till Monday 8am to be applied.

What are the scenarios this could be used for in real live?

- Sometimes the cluster is connected to external systems, which need to be in maintenance mode before updates can be applied.
- You want to be able to determin a designated time window when the next changes go into production, so that in case of issue you are able to react quickly.

So our problem in short:
_We want to be able to predefine time windows to deploy all new changes to a cluster that is managed by Flux._

To make things easier, let's call these time windows "reconciliation windows" and dig right into how to solve the problem.

## Core principles

Now how do we create such reconciliation windows using Flux and K8s native resources?
To go there we first need to understand how the Flux [`Kustomize`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/) and Flux [`Source`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/) controller work, and how we can leverage this to solve our problem.

When setting up a cluster with Flux there will always be a `Source` controller that reconciles the changes from the GitOps repository into the cluster.
After that, the `Kustomize` controller will poll the newest changes from the `Source` controller and apply them to the cluster.

Now interestingly enough both of the reconciliations of these controllers can be suspended.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Suspend <code >Source</code >/<code >Kustomize</code > controller from reconciling </th>
<th>Resume reconciling of <code >Source</code >/<code >Kustomize</code > controller</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
  
<pre><code>
flux resume source <span>&#60;</span>name<span>&#62;</span>
flux resume kustomization <span>&#60;</span>name<span>&#62;</span>
</code></pre>
  
</td>
<td>

<pre><code>
flux suspend source <span>&#60;</span>name<span>&#62;</span>
flux suspend kustomization <span>&#60;</span>name<span>&#62;</span>
</code></pre>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Especially the suspension of the `Kustomize` resource is for us of interest.

Since our goal is to suspend the reconciliation of the cluster state, the only controller we are interested to is the `Kustomize`. The `Source` contoller can continues syncing content as predefined interval.

## Schedule opening and closing of reconciliation windows

So far so good. But how do we automate this?
Well, K8s has already natively ways to support scheduling of jobs, which are [`CronJob` resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/), so why not use them?

We can create an `open-maintenance-window-job` and a `close-maintenance-window-job` which will use the Flux CLI and a service account to resume/suspend the kustomizations.
Lets take an example on the No-deployment Friday. For the reconciliation window from every Monday 8:00 am to Thursday 5:00 pm, this is how the jobs would look.

> Note: The ServiceAccount and the correspondong RoleBinding and Role is needed to give the job the right access to perform operations on the cluster resources. For more information on this see the [K8s docs on configuring service accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)

                - flux suspend kustomization infra -n flux-system; 
                  flux suspend kustomization apps -n flux-system;
          restartPolicy: Never
</code></pre>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Note: you can pretty much customize the window times as you want, by playing with the scheduling string set in `specs.schedule`. There are a few only tools to help you understand how these cron-strings work, eg [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/).

## Scale by using GitOps to manage reconciliation windows in GitOps

At this point, we have the capabilities to resume and suspend, but we still need to create the `CronJobs` manually for each cluster.

Imagine we have a GitOps repository that manages 10+ clusters. Not all of these clusters will probably have their reconciliation window set at the same time. Also, you don't want to manually have to create these jobs, let alone maintain the jobs if for example more `Kustomize` controller get added to the cluster.

Not to worry, there is also a solution for that ;)

I mean we are already using GitOps? Why not stick the definition of the job into the repository as part of our infrastructure?
And why not use kustomize's [patch functionality](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#customizing) to overwrite the CronJob's cron string to be able to customize the reconciliation window times for each cluster?

If that sounds interesting check out the [full sample for edge-01](https://github.com/MahrRah/flux-maintanance-windows-sample/tree/master/clusters/edge-01) here.
Now instead of having to manually create the ClusterRole, RoleBinding, ServiceAccount, and Jobs, Flux will take care of that for us.

## Conclusion

Now this is how we can leverage Flux and K8s native approaches to restrict the application of changes to a cluster to happen only in a reconciliation window.
There are a few advantages to this approach:

- For clusters running on the edge, if the connectivity goes down during a reconciliation window simple changes will still reconcile normally. This is because the `Source` Controller already pulled the newest changes.

  > Note: Careful this only works for image tag changes if there is a local ACR. Else the new images need to be pre-downloaded to the device

- The GitOps repository reflects the desired state after a reconciliation window of the cluster.
- No need to maintain a custom Gateway or such. All the used are open-source and there is no need for custom logic.
- During the reconciliation windows changes are applied like we used to know from Flux.

What we are however not solving with this, is scheduling fine granular changes. As you might have noticed the granularity end at every resource which is managed by the `Kustomize` resource the CronJobs suspend and resume. So individual configuration can not be managed with this approach.

_That did not solve your problem yet and your cluster needs real-time changes, as well as changes within a reconciliation window. Not to worry, got you ;) Check our [part 2](/) of this series._
